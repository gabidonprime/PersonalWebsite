      <p>
       Hello and welcome to my website! </p>
       <p> My name is Gabe and I am an undergraduate student at UNSW in Sydney. I've developed this website to showcase my skills in web development and to share my projects with the world. I am passionate about technology and I am always looking for new ways to get my hands dirty and learn as I go. </p>
       <p> I hope you enjoy your stay. Thanks for dropping by!
